# Changelog

## [0.3.0] - 2026-05-24

### New Features
- **Share via Link** — export tab now includes a "Share via Link" button that uploads the build code to the share service and returns a short URL. Both import fields (overlay and build select screen) accept either a raw `tli1_` code or a share link.
- **Crafted/Vorax item re-edit** — previously crafted and Vorax items in the build can now be reopened and edited directly from the gear screen instead of having to re-craft from scratch.
- **Instant screen navigation** — all season-global catalogs (legendary gear, craft bases, grafts, hero traits, hero memories, conditions) are now prefetched once at app init. Returning to GearScreen, HeroTraitScreen, BuildOverviewScreen, and PactSpiritScreen is instant after the first load.

### Improvements
- **Dual-value and range-multi affix display** — gear affixes that represent two separate ranges (dual-stat) or split min/max values now display and compute correctly.
- **Hero memory stat coverage** — alias lookups and multi-stat mappings added for hero memory modifiers that previously returned no stat contribution.
- **Stat resolver extended** — ~60 new stat enum values added; crit damage keys renamed for consistency; new override entries and normalization fixes for edge-case modifier text.

### Bug Fixes
- Fixed gear stat resolution for crafted items loaded from a saved build (affix `stat_key` fields were not being rehydrated on build open).
- Fixed Content Security Policy blocking outbound requests to the share service (`https://api.tlibuilder.com` added to `connect-src`).
